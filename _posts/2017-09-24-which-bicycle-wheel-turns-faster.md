Which bicycle wheel makes more turns over a given path &mdash; front or rear? Assume both wheels have the same diameter.
<!--more-->

On a track with any turns, the path of the front wheel is slightly longer, so it turns slightly faster.

Imagine the edge case where the front wheel is turned 90&deg; relative to the rear wheel, in which case the rear wheel does not travel at all, while the front wheel is making circles around it.
