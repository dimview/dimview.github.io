Most people have (on average) fewer friends than their friends have.

<!--more-->

It's one of those things that are obvious once you think about it, but not before. All you need is to realize that you are more likely to be friends with someone who has many friends.

It's kind of a thing you would think some ancient mathematician or philosopher wrote about. Yet there is no trace of it until 1991, when Scott L. Feld published his article in the American Journal of Sociology.
