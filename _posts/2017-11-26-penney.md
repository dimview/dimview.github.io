![Coins]({{ site.url }}/images/penney.jpg)

Two players are playing the following game:

* Player A picks a sequence of three consecutive coin toss results, e.g., Tails-Heads-Heads, and tells it to player B
* Player B picks another sequence of three consecutive coin toss results, e.g., Heads-Tails-Heads, and tells it to player A
* A coin is flipped repeatedly and results are written down until one of the sequences is observed
* The player who's sequence is observed first wins

Is the game fair?

This is [Penney's game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penney's_game), in which player B has an advantage.

Monte-Carlo simulation using [this program]({{ site.url }}/code/penney.cpp) gives the following odds of winning:

|a_seq  | b_seq |  b:a  |
