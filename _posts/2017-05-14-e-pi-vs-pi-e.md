What is greater, $$e^{\pi}$$ or $$\pi^e$$?

<!--more-->

Consider a function $$f(x)=\frac{e^x}{x^e}$$ and check if it's greater than 1 at $$x=\pi$$.

It's easy to see that $$f(e)=1$$, but we want to know which way the function goes from 
there.

$$f'(x)=e^x x^{-e} - e^x e x^{-e-1}=(x-e) e^x x^{-e-1}$$
which is positive for all $$x>e$$. So this function goes up when $$x>e$$. We know that 
$$\pi>e$$, therefore $$f(\pi)>1$$ and $$e^{\pi}>{\pi}^{e}$$.
