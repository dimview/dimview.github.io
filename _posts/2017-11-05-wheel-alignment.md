![Wheel alignment question]({{ site.url }}/images/wheel-alignment-question.jpg){:width="41%"}

Are front wheels of a turning car parallel?

<!--more-->

No. In order for a wheel not to slip it has to turn around a point somewhere along its axis. To see why, imagine a cone rolling on the table.

Axes of front wheels during the turn (green lines) intersect, therefore front wheels are not parallel.
