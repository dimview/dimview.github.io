There are four cards on a table. Each card has a number on one side and a letter on the other. The visible faces of the cards show **W**, **V**, **42**, and **7**.

Which card or cards do you need to turn over to check whether the following statement is true:

*"If a card has a **V** on one face, then the number on the opposite face is **greater than 20**"*

Now let's try another problem and see if it's easier.

There are four cards on a table. Each card has person's age on one side, and that person's drink on the other. The visible faces of the cards show **Water**, **Vodka**, **42**, and **7**.

Which card or cards do you need to turn over to check whether the following statement is true:

*"If a card has **Vodka** on one face, then the age on the opposite face is **at least 21**"*
