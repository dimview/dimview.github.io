A rare textbook: [No BS Guide to Math and Physics](https://minireference.com/) by Ivan Savov.

Unlike most modern textbooks, this one has very high signal to noise ratio - lots of useful content packed into few pages. Highly recommended.

Example: [mechanics in 7 pages](https://minireference.com/static/tutorials/mech_in_7_pages.pdf) (link goes to PDF)
