Back when electronic components were heavy and expensive, this nifty contraption was used to prevent air-to-air missiles from spinning en route to their target.

Airflow causes the wheel inside the eleron to spin. This wheel acts as gyroscope (resists rolling). 
Rolleron deflection creates aerodynamic force that cancels out missile roll.
