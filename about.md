Occasionally I stumble upon interesting bits of folklore, puzzles, tricks, and ideas but 
later forget the details, which makes it difficult to find original source when I need it. 
Sometimes the source itself is too long, and only a small portion of it is really 
interesting. The source can also disappear due to bit rot.

I will try to use this blog as my external memory, or cache, for such cases. The plan is 
to publish one blog post per week, starting on January 1st, 2017.

Entries will be pretty short, one picture and three paragraphs. Like this: 1 &#127748; 3 &#182;

Source code:
{% include icon-github.html username="dimview" %} /
[dimview.github.io](https://github.com/dimview/dimview.github.io)
